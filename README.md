# Whetstone

> "An Anvil forges a Dagger. A Whetstone sharpens it. And when you're not planning on using your Dagger, you may keep it in something that rhymes with kilt." â€” [Tiago Cunha](https://github.com/laggedHero).

Whetstone provides a simplified way to incorporate Dagger and Anvil into an Android application.

The goals of Whetstone are:
- To simplify Dagger-related infrastructure for Android apps.
- To create a standard set of components and scopes to ease setup, but allowing customizations.

Why would you use Whetstone instead of Hilt?
- No black-magic. No bytecode manipulation.
- No KAPT.
- Extensible by using Dagger's and Anvil's powers.

## Getting Started

First you must set up Dagger and Anvil. Once that is done, you need to add the following build dependencies to your module `build.gradle` file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation("com.deliveryhero.whetstone:whetstone")
    anvil("com.deliveryhero.whetstone:whetstone-compiler")
}
```
