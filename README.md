# Whetstone

> "An Anvil forges a Dagger. A Whetstone sharpens it. And when you're not planning on using your Dagger, you may keep it in something that rhymes with kilt." â€” [Tiago Cunha](https://github.com/laggedHero).

Whetstone provides a simplified way to incorporate Dagger and Anvil into an Android application.

The goals of Whetstone are:
- To simplify Dagger-related infrastructure for Android apps.
- To create a standard set of components and scopes to ease setup, but allowing customizations.

Why would you use Whetstone instead of Hilt?
- No black-magic. No bytecode manipulation.
- No KAPT.
- Extensible by using Dagger's and Anvil's powers.

## Getting Started

First you must set up Dagger and Anvil. Once that is done, you need to add the following build dependencies to your module `build.gradle` file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation("com.deliveryhero.whetstone:whetstone")
    anvil("com.deliveryhero.whetstone:whetstone-compiler")
}
```

## Basic Usage

To use `Whetstone` you must initialized it in your Application class.

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application(), ApplicationComponentOwner {

    override val applicationComponent by lazy {
        DaggerGeneratedApplicationComponent.factory().create(this)
    }
}
```

After that, you can easily inject into any Android class (see below).

### Guide

Unlike traditional Dagger, you do not need to define or instantiate Dagger components directly. Instead, we offer predefined components that are generated for you. Whetstone comes with a built-in set of components (and corresponding scope annotations) that are automatically integrated to the Android Framework. As normal, a binding in a child component can have dependencies on any binding in an ancestor component.

### Component Lifecycle

Component lifetimes are generally bounded by the creation and destruction of a corresponding instance of an important event. The table below lists the scope annotation and bounded lifetime for each component.

| Component            | Scope             | Created At                       | Destroyed At            |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ApplicationComponent | @ApplicationScope | Application#onCreate             | Application#onTerminate |
| ActivityComponent    | @ActivityScope    | Activity#onCreate                | Activity#onDestroy      |
| FragmentComponent    | @FragmentScope    | FragmentFactory#instantiate      | Fragment#onDestroy      |
| ViewModelComponent   | @ViewModelScope   | ViewModelProvider.Factory#create | ViewModel#onCleared     |
| ViewComponent        | @ViewScope        | View#init                        | View#finalize           |

### Application (DONE)

```kotlin
@ContributesInjector(ApplicationScope::class)
class MyApplication : Application(), ApplicationComponentOwner {

    override val applicationComponent by lazy {
        TODO("Create application component.")
    }

    @Inject
    lateinit var dependency: MyDependency

    fun onCreate() {
        Whetstone.inject(application = this)
        super.onCreate()
    }
}
```

### Activity (DONE)

```kotlin
@ContributesInjector(ActivityScope::class)
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    @Inject
    lateinit var dependency: MyDependency

    // Get the contributed ViewModel
    // We automatically handle process death and saved state handle wiring
    private val viewModel by injectedViewModel<MyViewModel>()

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        Whetstone.inject(activity = this)
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    }
}
```

### Fragments (DONE)

```kotlin
@ContributesFragment
class MyFragment @Inject constructor(
    private val dependency: MyDependency,
): Fragment() {

    // Get the contributed ViewModel
    // We automatically handle process death and saved state handle wiring
    private val viewModel by injectedViewModel<MyViewModel>()
}
```
**Important:** A Fragment should **NEVER** be scoped. The Android Framework controls the Lifecycle of **ALL** Fragments.

### ViewModels (DONE)

```kotlin
@ContributesViewModel
class MyViewModel @Inject constructor(
    private val savedStateHandle: SavedStateHandle,
): ViewModel()
```

**Important:** A ViewModel should **NEVER** be scoped. The Android Framework controls the Lifecycle of **ALL** ViewModels.

### Service (DONE)
Services should be generally avoided when possible. For most cases, workmanager can be a great alternative and 
is highly recommended. See the workmanager section for more details about how to use it with Whetstone

```kotlin
@ContributesInjector(ServiceScope::class)
class MyService : Service() {

    @Inject
    lateinit var dependency: MyDependency

    override fun onCreate() {
        Whetstone.inject(service = this)
        super.onCreate()
    }
}
```

### View (DONE)
**Disclaimer**: View injection should be avoided by all means. This provision is considered legacy and may be 
completely removed in a later version of Whetstone.

```kotlin
@ContributesInjector(ViewScope::class)
class MyView @JvmOverloads constructor(
    context: Context,
    attrs: AttributeSet? = null,
) : View(context, attrs) {

    @Inject
    lateinit var dependency: MainDependency

    init {
        if (!isInEditMode) {
            Whetstone.inject(view = this)
        }
    }
}
```

### Worker / WorkManager (DONE)
To use Whetstone's work manager integration, a separate dependency is required:

```kotlin
implementation("com.deliveryhero.whetstone:whetstone-worker")
```

This will automatically install Whetstone's worker factory (replacing the default factory), so that you can immediately
start taking advantage of injected workers

```kotlin
@ContributesWorker
class UploadWorker @Inject constructor(
    @ForScope(WorkerScope::class) context: Context,
    workerParameters: WorkerParameters,
    private val dependency: MyDependency,
): Worker(appContext, workerParameters)
```

To disable automatic initialization, you can remove the initializer from your AndroidManifest.xml

```xml
<provider
   android:name="androidx.startup.InitializationProvider"
   android:authorities="${applicationId}.androidx-startup"
   android:exported="false"
   tools:node="merge">
   <meta-data
       android:name="com.deliveryhero.whetstone.worker.WhetstoneWorkerInitializer"
       android:value="androidx.startup"
       tools:node="remove" />
</provider>
```

However, you must make sure to install Whetstone's worker factory before the first call to WorkManager.getInstance
to avoid breaking the integration. Whetstone provides an injectable `WorkerFactory` that can be used to configure
the work manager. For example, you can update your application class to implement work manager's `Configuration.Provider` and supply
Whetstone's `WorkerFactory` to the configuration builder
See the official [documentation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/advanced/custom-configuration) for more details

### Compose (DONE)
To use Whetstone's compose integration, a separate dependency is required

```kotlin
implementation("com.deliveryhero.whetstone:whetstone-compose")
```

Currently, this artefact only exposes APIs for injecting ViewModels that have been contributed to Whetstone

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen(viewModel: MyViewModel = injectedViewModel()) {
    // injectedViewModel takes care of providing the VM instance directly to this function
}
```
