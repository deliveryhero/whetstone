## ðŸ”’ Dependency Management with Dependabot

We use [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically) to automatically monitor and update our dependencies across all modules. This ensures that we promptly address any known security vulnerabilities and keep our libraries up to date.

Dependabot is configured to:
- Check for updates weekly.
- Monitor all modules within the repository.
- Create pull requests for outdated or vulnerable dependencies.

For more details, refer to our `.dependabot.yml` configuration.
